# storing-info-using-list

- Create a new Python file in this folder called list_types.py.
- Imagine you want to store the names of three of your friends in a list of
strings.
- Create a list variable called friends_names, and write the syntax to
- store the full names of three of your friends.
- Now, write statements to print out the name of the first friend, then the
name of the last friend, and finally the length of the list.
- Now, define a list called friends_ages that stores the age of each of your
friends in a corresponding manner, i.e., the first entry of this list is the age
of the friend named first in the other list
